  abstract = {The ability of primordial gas to cool in protogalactic haloes exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is critically dependent on the self-shielding of H2. We perform radiative transfer calculations of LW line photons, post-processing outputs from three-dimensional adaptive mesh refinement simulations of haloes with Tvir 104 K at z {$\sim$} 10. We calculate the optically thick photodissociation rate numerically, including the effects of density, temperature and velocity gradients in the gas, as well as line overlap and shielding of H2 by H I, over a large number of sightlines. In low-density regions (n 104 cm-3) the dissociation rates exceed those obtained using most previous approximations by more than an order of magnitude; the correction is smaller at higher densities. We trace the origin of the deviations primarily to inaccuracies of (i) the most common fitting formula for the suppression of the dissociation rate, from Draine and Bertoldi and (ii) estimates for the effective shielding column density from local properties of the gas. The combined effects of gas temperature and velocity gradients are comparatively less important, typically altering the spherically averaged rate only by a factor of 2. We present a simple modification to the Draine \& Bertoldi fitting formula for the optically thick rate which improves agreement with our numerical results to within {$\sim$}15 per cent, and can be adopted in future simulations. We find that estimates for the effective shielding column can be improved by using the local Sobolev length. Our correction to the H2 self-shielding reduces the critical LW flux to suppress H2 cooling in Tvir 104 K haloes by an order of magnitude; this increases the number of such haloes in which supermassive (M {$\sim$} 105 M ) black holes may have formed.},

Radiative feedback from massive stars can trigger nearby star formation in dense self-shielded clouds. In model radiation self-shielding, the H2 column density must be accurately computed. In this study, we compare two local approximations based on the density gradient and Jeans length with a direct integration of column density along rays. After the primary massive star forms, we find that no secondary stars form for both the direct integration and density gradient approaches. The approximate method reduces the computation time by a factor of 2. The Jeans length approximation overestimates the H2 column density by a factor of 10, leading to five numerically enhanced self-shielded, star-forming clumps. We conclude that the density gradient approximation is sufficiently accurate for larger volume galaxy simulations, although one must still caution that the approximation cannot fully reproduce the result of direct integration.},

  abstract = {We describe a phenomenological model for molecular hydrogen formation suited for applications in galaxy formation simulations, which includes nonequilibrium formation of H2 on dust and approximate treatment of both its self-shielding and shielding by dust from the dissociating UV radiation. The model is applicable in simulations in which individual star-forming regions{\textemdash}the giant molecular complexes{\textemdash}can be identified (resolution of tens of parsecs) and their mean internal density estimated reliably, even if internal structure is not resolved. In agreement with previous studies, calculations based on our model show that the transition from atomic to fully molecular phase depends primarily on the metallicity, which we assume is directly related to the dust abundance, and clumpiness of the interstellar medium. The clumpiness simply boosts the formation rate of molecular hydrogen, while dust serves both as a catalyst of H2 formation and as an additional shielding from dissociating UV radiation. The upshot is that it is difficult to form fully shielded giant molecular clouds while gas metallicity is low. However, once the gas is enriched to Z {$\sim$} 0.01{\textendash}0.1 Z{$\Sun$}, the subsequent star formation and enrichment can proceed at a much faster rate. This may keep star formation efficiency in the low-mass, low-metallicity progenitors of galaxies very low for a certain period of time with the effect similar to a strong ``feedback'' mechanism. The effect may help explain the steep increase of the mass-to-light ratio toward smaller masses observed in the local galaxy population. We apply the model and star formation recipes based on the local amount of molecular gas to an output from a cosmological simulation of galaxy formation and show that resulting global correlations between star formation and gas, and H2 surface densities are in good agreement with observations.},

Such an approach allows us to avoid the arbitrary density and temperature thresholds typically used in star formation recipes in galaxy formation simulations. We present results of the model based on realistic cosmological simulations of high-z galaxy formation for a grid of numerical models with varied dust-to-gas ratios and interstellar far-UV (FUV) fluxes. Our results show that both the atomic-tomolecular transition on small, tens-of-parsec scales and the Kennicutt{\textendash}Schmidt (K-S) relation on large, kiloparsec scales are sensitive to the dust-to-gas ratio and the FUV flux. The atomic-to-molecular transition as a function of gas density or column density has a large scatter but is rather sharp and shifts to higher densities with decreasing dust-to-gas ratio and/or increasing FUV flux. Consequently, star formation is concentrated to higher gas surface density regions, resulting in steeper slope and lower amplitude of the K-S relation at a given {$\Sigma$}H, in less dusty and/or higher FUV flux environments. We parameterize the dependences observed in our simulations in convenient fitting formulae, which can be used to model the dependence of the K-S relation on the dust-to-gas ratio and FUV flux in semi-analytic models and in cosmological simulations that do not include radiative transfer and H2 formation. Finally, we show that ionized gas can contribute a significant fraction of the total gas surface density in environments typical for high-redshift galaxies.},

  abstract = {High-redshift quasars at z {$>$} 6 have masses up to {$\sim$}109 M . One of the pathways to their formation includes direct collapse of gas, forming a supermassive star, precursor of the black hole seed. The conditions for direct collapse are more easily achievable in metal-free haloes, where atomic hydrogen cooling operates and molecular hydrogen (H2) formation is inhibited by a strong external (ultraviolet) UV flux. Above a certain value of UV flux (Jcrit), the gas in a halo collapses isothermally at {$\sim$}104 K and provides the conditions for supermassive star formation. However, H2 can self-shield, reducing the effect of photodissociation. So far, most numerical studies used the local Jeans length to calculate the column densities for selfshielding. We implement an improved method for the determination of column densities in 3D simulations and analyse its effect on the value of Jcrit. This new method captures the gas geometry and velocity field and enables us to properly determine the direction-dependent self-shielding factor of H2 against photodissociating radiation. We find a value of Jcrit that is a factor of 2 smaller than with the Jeans approach ({$\sim$}2000 J21 versus {$\sim$}4000 J21). The main reason for this difference is the strong directional dependence of the H2 column density. With this lower value of Jcrit, the number of haloes exposed to a flux {$>$} Jcrit is larger by more than an order of magnitude compared to previous studies. This may translate into a similar enhancement in the predicted number density of black hole seeds.},

  abstract = {We present a new method for estimating the H2 cooling rate in the optically thick regime in simulations of primordial star formation. Our new approach is based on the TreeCol algorithm, which projects matter distributions onto a spherical grid to create maps of column densities for each fluid element in the computational domain. We have improved this algorithm by using the relative gas velocities to weight the individual matter contributions with the relative spectral line overlaps, in order to properly account for the Doppler effect. We compare our new method to the widely used Sobolev approximation, which yields an estimate for the column density based on the local velocity gradient and the thermal velocity. This approach generally underestimates the photon escape probability because it neglects the density gradient and the actual shape of the cloud. We present a correction factor for the true line overlap in the Sobolev approximation and a new method based on local quantities, which fits the exact results reasonably well during the collapse of the cloud, with the error in the cooling rates always being less than 10\%. Analytical fitting formulae fail at determining the photon escape probability after formation of the first protostar (error of {$\sim$}40\%) because they are based on the assumption of spherical symmetry and therefore break down once a protostellar accretion disk has formed. Our method yields lower temperatures and hence promotes fragmentation for densities above {$\sim$}1010 cm-3 at a distance of {$\sim$}200 AU from the first protostar. Since the overall accretion rates are hardly affected by the cooling implementation, we expect Pop III stars to have lower masses in our simulations, compared to the results of previous simulations that used the Sobolev approximation.},

  abstract = {We study the formation of H2 in the ISM, using a modified version of the astrophysical magnetohydrodynamical code ZEUS-MP that includes a nonequilibrium treatment of the formation and destruction of H2. We examine two different approximations to treat the shielding of H2 against photodissociation: a local approximation, which gives us a solid lower bound on the amount of shielding, and a method based on ray-tracing that is considerably more accurate in some circumstances but that produces results that are harder to clearly interpret. In both cases, the computational cost of determining H2 photodissociation rates is reduced by enough to make three-dimensional high-resolution simulations of cloud formation feasible with modest computational resources. Our modification to ZEUS-MP also includes a detailed treatment of the thermal behavior of the gas. In this paper, we focus on the problem of molecular cloud formation in gravitationally unstable, initially static gas. (In a subsequent paper, we consider turbulent flow.) We show that in these conditions, and for initial densities consistent with those observed in the cold, neutral atomic phase of the interstellar medium, H2 formation occurs on a timescale t ! 10 Myr, comparable to or longer than the gravitational free-fall timescale of the cloud. We also show that the collapsing gas very quickly reaches thermal equilibrium and that the equation of state of the thermal equilibrium gas is generally softer than isothermal. Finally, we demonstrate that although these results show little sensitivity to variations in most of our simulation parameters, they are highly sensitive to the assumed initial density ni. Reducing ni significantly increases the cloud formation timescale and decreases the amount of hydrogen ultimately converted to H2.},

Starting with purely atomic hydrogen, large quantities of molecular hydrogen can be produced on timescales of 1Y2 Myr, given turbulent velocity dispersions and magnetic field strengths consistent with observations. Moreover, as our simulations underestimate the effectiveness of H2 self-shielding and dust absorption, we can be confident that the molecular fractions that we compute are strong lower limits on the true values. The formation of large quantities of molecular gas on the timescale required by rapid cloud formation models therefore appears to be entirely plausible. We also investigate the density and temperature distributions of gas in our model clouds. We show that the density probability distribution function is approximately lognormal, with a dispersion that agrees well with the prediction of Padoan and coworkers. The temperature distribution is similar to that of a polytrope, with an effective polytropic index eA ' 0:8, although at low gas densities, the scatter of the actual gas temperature around this mean value is considerable, and the polytropic approximation does not capture the full range of behavior of the gas.},

We additionally compare these raytracing-based solutions to photochemistry with complementary models where photoshielding is accounted for with locally computed prescriptions. With some exceptions, these local models for the radiative shielding length perform reasonably well at reproducing the distribution and amount of molecular gas as compared with a detailed, global ray-tracing calculation.

We find that a multifrequency treatment of the individual H2 lines is essential, since for high optical depths the smaller cross-section in the wings of the lines greatly increases the amount of energy that can escape. The influence of Doppler shifts due to bulk velocities is comparatively small, since systematic velocity differences in the cloud are typically smaller than the sound speed. During the initial collapse phase, the radially averaged escape fraction agrees relatively well with the fit of Ripamonti \& Abel. However, in general it is not advisable to use a simple density-dependent fitting function, since the escape fraction depends on many factors and does not capture the suppression of density perturbations due to the diffusion of radiation. The Sobolev method overestimates the escape fraction by more than an order of magnitude, since the properties of the gas change on scales smaller than the Sobolev length.},

  abstract = {One possible scenario for the formation of massive black holes (BHs) in the early Universe is from the direct collapse of primordial gas in atomic-cooling dark matter haloes in which the gas is unable to cool efficiently via molecular transitions. We study the formation of such BHs, as well as the accretion of gas on to these objects and the high energy radiation emitted in the accretion process, by carrying out cosmological radiation hydrodynamic simulations. In the absence of radiative feedback, we find an upper limit to the accretion rate on to the central object which forms from the initial collapse of hot ( 104 K) gas of the order of 0.1 M yr-1. This is high enough for the formation of a supermassive star, the immediate precursor of a BH, with a mass of the order of 105 M . Assuming that a fraction of this mass goes into a BH, we track the subsequent accretion of gas on to the BH self-consistently with the high energy radiation emitted from the accretion disc. Using a ray-tracing algorithm to follow the propagation of ionizing radiation, we model in detail the growth and evolution of the H II and He III regions which form around the accreting BH. We find that BHs with masses of the order of 104 M initially accrete at close to the Eddington limit, but that the accretion rate drops to {$\sim$}10-5 M yr-1 (of the order 1 per cent of the Eddington limit) after {$\sim$}106 yr, due to the expansion of the gas near the BH in response to strong photoheating and radiation pressure. One distinctive signature of the accretion of gas on to BHs formed by direct collapse, as opposed to massive Pop III star formation, is an extremely high ratio of the luminosity emitted in He II {$\lambda$}1640 to that emitted in H{$\alpha$} (or Ly{$\alpha$}), i.e. L1640/LH{$\alpha$} {$\geq$} 2; this nebular emission could be detected by future facilities, such as the James Webb Space Telescope. Finally, we briefly discuss implications for the coevolution of BHs and their host galaxies.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the open-source code Enzo, which uses block-structured adaptive mesh refinement to provide high spatial and temporal resolution for modeling astrophysical fluid flows. The code is Cartesian, can be run in one, two, and three dimensions, and supports a wide variety of physics including hydrodynamics, ideal and non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics, N-body dynamics (and, more broadly, self-gravity of fluids and particles), primordial gas chemistry, optically thin radiative cooling of primordial and metal-enriched plasmas (as well as some optically-thick cooling models), radiation transport, cosmological expansion, and models for star formation and feedback in a cosmological context. In addition to explaining the algorithms implemented, we present solutions for a wide range of test problems, demonstrate the code's parallel performance, and discuss the Enzo collaboration's code development methodology.},

  abstract = {This paper presents cosmological results based on full-mission Planck observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. Our results are in very good agreement with the 2013 analysis of the Planck nominal-mission temperature data, but with increased precision. The temperature and polarization power spectra are consistent with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base {$\Lambda$}CDM" in this paper). From the Planck temperature data combined with Planck lensing, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, H0 = (67.8 {$\pm$} 0.9) km s-1Mpc-1, a matter density parameter {$\Omega$}m = 0.308 {$\pm$} 0.012, and a tilted scalar spectral index with ns = 0.968 {$\pm$} 0.006, consistent with the 2013 analysis. Note that in this abstract we quote 68\% confidence limits on measured parameters and 95\% upper limits on other parameters. We present the first results of polarization measurements with the Low Frequency Instrument at large angular scales. Combined with the Planck temperature and lensing data, these measurements give a reionization optical depth of {$\tau$} = 0.066 {$\pm$} 0.016, corresponding to a reionization redshift of z\_re=8.8+1.7-1.4. These results are consistent with those from WMAP polarization measurements cleaned for dust emission using 353-GHz polarization maps from the High Frequency Instrument. We find no evidence for any departure from base {$\Lambda$}CDM in the neutrino sector of the theory; for example, combining Planck observations with other astrophysical data we find Neff = 3.15 {$\pm$} 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, consistent with the value Neff = 3.046 of the Standard Model of particle physics. The sum of neutrino masses is constrained to {$\sum$} m{$\nu$} {$<$} 0.23 eV. The spatial curvature of our Universe is found to be very close to zero, with {\textbar} {$\Omega$}K {\textbar} {$<$} 0.005. Adding a tensor component as a single-parameter extension to base {$\Lambda$}CDM we find an upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r0.002{$<$} 0.11, consistent with the Planck 2013 results and consistent with the B-mode polarization constraints from a joint analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck (BKP) data. Adding the BKP B-mode data to our analysis leads to a tighter constraint of r0.002 {$<$} 0.09 and disfavours inflationarymodels with a V({$\varphi$}) {$\propto$} {$\varphi$}2 potential. The addition of Planck polarization data leads to strong constraints on deviations from a purely adiabatic spectrum of fluctuations. We find no evidence for any contribution from isocurvature perturbations or from cosmic defects. Combining Planck data with other astrophysical data, including Type Ia supernovae, the equation of state of dark energy is constrained to w = -1.006 {$\pm$} 0.045, consistent with the expected value for a cosmological constant. The standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the best-fit Planck base {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We also constraints on annihilating dark matter and on possible deviations from the standard recombination history. In neither case do we find no evidence for new physics. The Planck results for base {$\Lambda$}CDM are in good agreement with baryon acoustic oscillation data and with the JLA sample of Type Ia supernovae. However, as in the 2013 analysis, the amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum is found to be higher than inferred from some analyses of rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. We show that these tensions cannot easily be resolved with simple modifications of the base {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology. Apart from these tensions, the base {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the Planck CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.},

  abstract = {It is assumed that the rate of star formation for population I varies with a power n of the density of interstellar gas and that the initial luminosity function is time-independent. Direct evidence on the value of n is found in the relative distribution, perpendicular to the galactic plane, of gas and young objects. For various values of n, computations were made of the initial luminosity function, the rate of star formation, the exchange of gas between stars and interstellar medium, the number of white dwarfs and their luminosity function, and the abundance of helium. It is concluded, from a comparison of the results with observational data, that n is around 2. The present rate of star formation, then, is five times slower than the average rate. The interstellar gas, of which the surface density on the galactic plane was taken to be 11 per square parsec, loses 1.4 O/pc2 per 10 years by the formation of stars but gains about one-third of this by ejection of gas from evolving stars. The present helium abundance of the interstellar gas may be explained if a star has burned, on the average, 53 per cent of its original hydrogen into helium at the time that ejection takes place. The ejected material was assumed to have a composition equal to the average composition of the star. The effect of star formation on the gas density in the galactic system and other galaxies is briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {We compare molecular gas traced by 12CO (2--1) maps from the HERACLES survey, with tracers of the recent star formation rate (SFR) across 30 nearby disk galaxies. We demonstrate a first-order linear correspondence between {$\Sigma$}mol and {$\Sigma$}SFR but also find important second-order systematic variations in the apparent molecular gas depletion time, {$\tau$}dmepol = {$\Sigma$}mol/{$\Sigma$}SFR. At the 1 kpc common resolution of HERACLES, CO emission correlates closely with many tracers of the recent SFR. Weighting each line of sight equally, using a fixed {$\alpha$}CO equivalent to the Milky Way value, our data yield a molecular gas depletion time, {$\tau$}dmepol = {$\Sigma$}mol/{$\Sigma$}SFR {$\approx$} 2.2 Gyr with 0.3 dex 1{$\sigma$} scatter, in very good agreement with recent literature data. We apply a forward-modeling approach to constrain the power-law index, N, that relates the SFR surface density and the molecular gas surface density, {$\Sigma$}SFR {$\propto$} {$\Sigma$}Nmol. We find N = 1 {\textpm} 0.15 for our full data set with some scatter from galaxy to galaxy. This also agrees with recent work, but we caution that a power-law treatment oversimplifies the topic given that we observe correlations between {$\tau$}dmepol and other local and global quantities. The strongest of these are a decreased {$\tau$}dmepol in low-mass, low-metallicity galaxies and a correlation of the kpc-scale {$\tau$}dmepol with dust-to-gas ratio, D/G. These correlations can be explained by a CO-to-H2 conversion factor ({$\alpha$}CO) that depends on dust shielding, and thus D/G, in the theoretically expected way. This is not a unique interpretation, but external evidence of conversion factor variations makes this the most conservative explanation of the strongest observed {$\tau$}dmepol trends. After applying a D/G-dependent {$\alpha$}CO, some weak correlations between {$\tau$}dmepol and local conditions persist. In particular, we observe lower {$\tau$}dmepol and enhanced CO excitation associated with nuclear gas concentrations in a subset of our targets. These appear to reflect real enhancements in the rate of star formation per unit gas, and although the distribution of {$\tau$}dep does not appear bimodal in galaxy centers, {$\tau$}dep does appear multivalued at fixed {$\Sigma$}H2, supporting the idea of ``disk'' and ``starburst'' modes driven by other environmental parameters.},

  abstract = {The structure of stationary photodissociation fronts is revisited. H2 self-shielding is discussed, including the effects of line overlap. We find that line overlap is important for N(H2) {$\geq$} 1020 cm-2, with a factor-of-2 suppression of pumping rates at column densities N(H2) 3 x 1020 cm-2 cm-2. We compute multiline UV pumping models and compare these with simple analytic approximations for the effects of self-shielding. The overall fluorescent efficiency of the photodissociation front is obtained for different ratios of {$\chi$}/nH (where {$\chi$} characterizes the intensity of the illuminating ultraviolet radiation) and different dust extinction laws. The dust optical depth {$\tau$}pdr to the point where 50\% of the H is molecular is found to be a simple function of a dimensionless quantity {$\varphi$}0 depending on {$\chi$}/nH, the rate coefficient R(T) for H2 formation on grains, and the UV dust opacity. The fluorescent efficiency of the photodissocation region (PDR) also depends primarily on {$\varphi$} for {$\chi$} {$\leq$} 3000 and nH {$\leq$} 104 cm-3; for stronger radiation fields and higher densities, radiative and collisional depopulation of vibrationally excited levels interferes with the radiative cascade. We show that the emission spectrum from the PDR is essentially independent of the color temperature Tcolor of the illuminating radiation for 104 K Tcolor but shows some sensitivity to the rotation-vibration distribution of newly formed H2. The 1-0 S(1)/2-1 S(1) and 2-1 S(1)/6-4 Q(1) intensity ratios, the ortho/para ratio, and the rotational temperature in the v = 1 and v = 2 levels are computed as functions of the temperature and density for different values of {$\chi$}/nH. We apply our models to the reflection nebula NGC 2023. Apparent inconsistencies between published K-band and far-red spectroscopy of this object are discussed; we adjust the two sets of observations for consistency. We are able to reproduce approximately the (adjusted) observations with models having {$\chi$} = 5000, nH = 105 cm-3, and a reasonable viewing angle. Further observations of NGC 2023 will be valuable to clarify the uncertain spatial structure of the emission.},

  abstract = {Motivated by the observed connection between molecular hydrogen (H2) and star formation, we present a method for tracking the non-equilibrium abundance and cooling processes of H2 and H2-based star formation in smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations. The local abundances of H2 are calculated by integrating over the hydrogen chemical network. This calculation includes the gas phase and dust grain formation of H2, shielding of H2 and photodissociation of H2 by Lyman--Werner radiation from nearby stellar populations. Because this model does not assume equilibrium abundances, it is particularly well suited for simulations that model low-metallicity environments, such as dwarf galaxies and the early Universe. We further introduce an explicit link between star formation and local H2 abundance. This link limits star formation to `star-forming regions', represented by areas with abundant H2. We use simulations of isolated disc galaxies to verify that the transition from atomic to molecular hydrogen occurs at realistic densities and surface densities. Using these same isolated galaxies, we establish that gas particles of 104 M or less are necessary to follow the molecular gas in this implementation.},

  abstract = {We describe a photon-conserving radiative transfer algorithm, using a spatially-adaptive raytracing scheme, and its parallel implementation into the adaptive mesh refinement cosmological hydrodynamics code ENZO. By coupling the solver with the energy equation and nonequilibrium chemistry network, our radiation hydrodynamics framework can be utilized to study a broad range of astrophysical problems, such as stellar and black hole feedback. Inaccuracies can arise from large time-steps and poor sampling; therefore, we devised an adaptive time-stepping scheme and a fast approximation of the optically-thin radiation field with multiple sources. We test the method with several radiative transfer and radiation hydrodynamics tests that are given in Iliev et al. We further test our method with more dynamical situations, for example, the propagation of an ionization front through a Rayleigh--Taylor instability, time-varying luminosities and collimated radiation. The test suite also includes an expanding H II region in a magnetized medium, utilizing the newly implemented magnetohydrodynamics module in ENZO. This method linearly scales with the number of point sources and number of grid cells. Our implementation is scalable to 512 processors on distributed memory machines and can include the radiation pressure and secondary ionizations from X-ray radiation. It is included in the newest public release of ENZO.},

The approach is based on adaptive hierarchical refinement of friends-of-friends groups in six phase-space dimensions and one time dimension, which allows for robust (grid-independent, shape-independent, and noise-resilient) tracking of substructure; as such, it is named rockstar (Robust Overdensity Calculation using K-Space Topologically Adaptive Refinement). Our method is massively parallel (up to 105 CPUs) and runs on the largest current simulations ({$>$}1010 particles) with high efficiency (10 CPU hours and 60 gigabytes of memory required per billion particles analyzed). A previous paper has shown rockstar to have excellent recovery of halo properties; we expand on these comparisons with more tests and higher-resolution simulations. We show a significant improvement in substructure recovery compared to several other halo finders and discuss the theoretical and practical limits of simulations in this regard. Finally, we present results that demonstrate conclusively that dark matter halo cores are not at rest relative to the halo bulk or substructure average velocities and have coherent velocity offsets across a wide range of halo masses and redshifts. For massive clusters, these offsets can be up to 350 km s-1 at z = 0 and even higher at high redshifts. Our implementation is publicly available at http://code.google.com/p/rockstar.},

Our algorithm has demonstrated the ability to improve both the completeness (through detecting and inserting otherwise missing halos) and purity (through detecting and removing spurious objects) of both merger trees and halo catalogs. In addition, our method is able to robustly measure the self-consistency of halo finders; it is the first to directly measure the uncertainties in halo positions, halo velocities, and the halo mass function for a given halo finder based on consistency between snapshots in cosmological simulations. We use this algorithm to generate merger trees for two large simulations (Bolshoi and Consuelo) and evaluate two halo finders (rockstar and bdm). We find that both the rockstar and bdm halo finders track halos extremely well; in both, the number of halos which do not have physically consistent progenitors is at the 1\%--2\% level across all halo masses.

  abstract = {The ultraviolet background (UVB) emitted by quasars and galaxies governs the ionization and thermal state of the intergalactic medium (IGM), regulates the formation of high-redshift galaxies, and is thus a key quantity for modeling cosmic reionization. The vast majority of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations implement the UVB via a set of spatially uniform photoionization and photoheating rates derived from UVB synthesis models. We show that simulations using canonical UVB rates reionize and, perhaps more importantly, spuriously heat the IGM, much earlier (z {\textasciitilde} 15) than they should. This problem arises because at z {$>$} 6, where observational constraints are nonexistent, the UVB amplitude is far too high. We introduce a new methodology to remedy this issue, and we generate self-consistent photoionization and photoheating rates to model any chosen reionization history. Following this approach, we run a suite of hydrodynamical simulations of different reionization scenarios and explore the impact of the timing of reionization and its concomitant heat injection on the thermal state of the IGM. We present a comprehensive study of the pressure smoothing scale of IGM gas, illustrating its dependence on the details of both hydrogen and helium reionization, and argue that it plays a fundamental role in interpreting Ly{$\alpha$} forest statistics and the thermal evolution of the IGM. The premature IGM heating we have uncovered implies that previous work has likely dramatically overestimated the impact of photoionization feedback on galaxy formation, which sets the minimum halo mass able to form stars at high redshifts. We make our new UVB photoionization and photoheating rates publicly available for use in future simulations.},

While self-shielded regions manifest as Lyman limit systems in the post-reionization Universe, here we focus on their evolution during reionization (redshifts z~=~6--10). At these redshifts, the spatial distribution of hydrogen-ionizing radiation is highly inhomogeneous, and some regions of the Universe are still neutral. After masking the neutral regions and ionizing sources in the simulation, we find that the hydrogen photoionization rate depends on the local hydrogen density in a manner very similar to that in the post-reionization Universe. The characteristic physical hydrogen density above which self-shielding becomes important at these redshifts is about nH~{$\sim~$}3~{\texttimes}~10-3~cm-3, or {$\sim$}20~times the mean hydrogen density, reflecting the fact that during reionization photoionization rates are typically low enough that the filaments in the cosmic web are often self-shielded. The value of the typical self-shielding density decreases by a factor of 3 between redshifts z~=~3 and 10, and follows the evolution of the average photoionization rate in ionized regions in a simple fashion. We provide a simple parametrization of the photoionization rate as a function of density in self-shielded regions during the epoch of reionization.},

  abstract = {The process of molecule formation in the primordial gas is considered in the framework of Friedmann cosmological models from redshift z=10(4) to z=0. First, a comprehensive analysis of 87 gas phase reaction rates (both collisional and radiative) relevant in the physical environment of the expanding universe is presented and critically discussed. On this basis, calculations are carried out of the abundance of 21 molecular species as function of redshift, for different values of the cosmological parameters Omega\_0 , eta and H\_0, evaluating consistently the molecular heating and cooling due to H\_2, HD and LiH molecules. One of the major improvements of this work is the use of a better treatment of H recombination that leads to a reduction of a factor 2-3 in the abundance of electrons and H(+) at freeze-out, with respect to previous studies. The lower residual ionization has a negative effect on the chemistry of the primordial gas in which electrons and protons act as catalysts in the formation of the first molecules. We find that in the standard model (h=0.67, eta\_ \{10\}=4.5, Omega\_0 =1 and [D/H] =4.3x 10(-5) ), the residual fractional ionization at z=1 is [e/H]=3.02x 10(-4) , and the main molecular species fractional abundances [H\_2/H]=1.1x 10(-6) , [HD/H\_2]=1.1x 10(-3) , [HeH(+/) H]=6.2x 10(-13) , [LiH(+/) H]=9.4x 10(-18) and [LiH/LiH(+]=7.6x) 10(-3) . We devise a reduced chemical network that reproduces with excellent accuracy the numerical results of the complete model and allows to follow the chemical compositions and the thermal properties of a primordial gas in the presence of an external radiation field. Finally, we provide accurate cooling functions of H\_2, HD and LiH in a wide range of density and temperature that can be conveniently used in a variety of cosmological applications.},

This method combines N-body cosmological simulations and semi-analytic techniques to extract realistic initial conditions for galaxy mergers. These are then evolved using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, which include dark matter, stars, cold gas in the disc and hot gas in the halo. We show that the satellite mass accretion is not as effective as previously thought, as there is substantial stellar stripping before the final merger. The fraction of stellar disc mass transferred to the bulge is quite low, even in the case of a major merger, mainly due to the dispersion of part of the stellar disc mass into the halo. We confirm the findings of Hopkins et~al., that a gas-rich disc is able to survive major mergers more efficiently. The enhanced star formation associated with the merger is not localized to the bulge of galaxy, but a substantial fraction takes place in the disc too. The inclusion of the hot gas reservoir in the galaxy model contributes to reducing the efficiency of bulge formation. Overall, our findings suggest that mergers are not as efficient as previously thought in transforming discs into bulges. This possibly alleviates some of the tensions between observations of bulgeless galaxies and the hierarchical scenario for structure formation.},

  abstract = {The evolution of the galaxy stellar mass--star formation rate relationship (M{$\ast$} --SFR) provides key constraints on the stellar mass assembly histories of galaxies. For star-forming galaxies, M{$\ast$} --SFR is observed to be fairly tight with a slope close to unity from z {$\sim$} 0 {$\rightarrow$} 2, and it evolves downwards roughly independently of M{$\ast$} . Simulations of galaxy formation reproduce these trends, broadly independent of modelling details, owing to the generic dominance of smooth and steady cold accretion in these systems. In contrast, the observed amplitude of the M{$\ast$} --SFR relation evolves markedly differently than in models, indicating either that stellar mass assembly is poorly understood or that observations have been misinterpreted. Stated in terms of a star formation activity parameter {$\alpha$}sf {$\equiv$} (M{$\ast$} /SFR)/(tHubble--1 Gyr), models predict a constant {$\alpha$}sf {$\sim$} 1 out to redshifts z {$\sim$} 4+, while the observed M{$\ast$} --SFR relation indicates that {$\alpha$}sf increases by approximately three times from z {$\sim$} 2 until today. The low {$\alpha$}sf (i.e. rapid star formation) at high z not only conflicts with models, but also difficult to reconcile with other observations of high-z galaxies, such as the small scatter in M{$\ast$} --SFR, the slow evolution of star-forming galaxies at z {$\sim$} 2--4 and the modest passive fractions in mass-selected samples. Systematic biases could significantly affect measurements of M{$\ast$} and SFR, but detailed considerations suggest that none are obvious candidates to reconcile the discrepancy. A speculative solution is considered in which the stellar initial mass function (IMF) evolves towards more highmass star formation at earlier epochs. Following Larson, a model is investigated in which the characteristic mass M{\textasciicircum} where the IMF turns over increases with redshift. Population synthesis models are used to show that the observed and predicted M{$\ast$} --SFR evolution may be brought into broad agreement if M{\textasciicircum} = 0.5 (1 + z)2 M out to z {$\sim$} 2. Such IMF evolution matches recent observations of cosmic stellar mass growth, and the resulting z = 0 cumulative IMF is similar to the `paunchy' IMF favoured by Fardal et al. to reconcile the observed cosmic star formation history with present-day fossil light measures.},

The fraction of ionizing radiation that escapes into the intergalactic medium from dwarf galaxies with masses less than {\textasciitilde}109.5 solar masses plays a critical role during this epoch. Using an extensive suite of very high resolution (0.1 pc), adaptive mesh refinement, radiation hydrodynamical simulations of idealized and cosmological dwarf galaxies, we characterize the behavior of the escape fraction in galaxies between 3 {\texttimes} 106 and 3 {\texttimes} 109 solar masses with different spin parameters, amounts of turbulence, and baryon mass fractions. For a given halo mass, escape fractions can vary up to a factor of two, depending on the initial setup of the idealized halo. In a cosmological setting, we find that the time-averaged photon escape fraction always exceeds 25\% and reaches up to 80\% in halos with masses above 108 solar masses with a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF). The instantaneous escape fraction can vary up to an order of magnitude in a few million years and tends to be positively correlated with star formation rate. We find that the mean of the star formation efficiency times ionizing photon escape fraction, averaged over all atomic cooling (T vir {$>$}= 8000 K) galaxies, ranges from 0.02 for a normal IMF to 0.03 for a top-heavy IMF, whereas smaller, molecular cooling galaxies in minihalos do not make a significant contribution to reionizing the universe due to much lower star formation rates. These results provide the physical basis for cosmological reionization by stellar sources, predominately atomic cooling dwarf galaxies.},

Here, we analyze the results of these simulations in terms of the structure, composition, and phase dynamics of the CGM. We show properties such as metal distribution, ionization levels, and kinematics are effective tracers of the effects of the different code feedback and implementation methods, and as such they can be highly divergent between simulations. This is merely a fiducial set of models, against which we will in the future compare multiple feedback recipes for each code. Nevertheless, we find that the large parameter space these simulations establish can help disentangle the different variables that affect observable quantities in the CGM, e.g., showing that abundances for ions with higher ionization energy are more strongly determined by the simulation's metallicity, while abundances for ions with lower ionization energy are more strongly determined by the gas density and temperature.},

We perform techniques popular in the literature and present a new technique of our own, where the aperture radius is based on the baryonic mass profiles of simulated (sub)haloes. For the average Milky Way-mass system, we find the two most popular techniques in the literature return differences of the order of 30~per cent for stellar mass, a factor of 3 for gas mass, 40~per cent for star formation rate, and factors of several for gas accretion and ejection rates. Individual cases can show variations greater than this, with the severity dependent on the concentration of a given system. The average difference in integrated properties for a more general galaxy population is not as striking, but is still significant for stellar and gas mass, especially for optical-limit apertures. The large differences that can occur are problematic for comparing results from various publications. We stress the importance of both defining and justifying a technique choice and discourage using popular apertures that use an exact fraction of the virial radius, due to the unignorable variation in galaxy-to-(sub)halo size. Finally, we note that technique choice does not greatly affect simulated galaxies from lying within the scatter of observed scaling relations, but it can alter the derived best-fitting slope for the Kennicutt--Schmidt relation.},

The peak gas temperatures behind the I-fronts, , are a key uncertainty in models of the thermal history after reionization. Here we use high-resolution radiative transfer (RT) simulations to study the parameter space of . We show that is only mildly sensitive to the spectrum of incident radiation over most of the parameter space, with temperatures set primarily by I-front speeds. We also explore what current models of reionization predict for by measuring I-front speeds in cosmological RT simulations. We find that the post-I-front temperatures evolve toward hotter values as reionization progresses. Temperatures of = 17,000--22,000 K are typical during the first half of reionization, but = 25,000--30,000 K may be achieved near the end of this process if I-front speeds reach {$\sim$}104 km s-1, as found in our simulations. Shorter reionization epochs lead to hotter . We discuss implications for z {$>$} 5 Ly{$\alpha$} forest observations, which potentially include sight lines through hot, recently reionized patches of the universe. Interpolation tables from our parameter space study are made publicly available, along with a simple fit for the dependence of on the I-front speed.},

	abstract = {The universe goes through several phase transitions during its formative stages. Cosmic reionisation is the last of them, where ultraviolet and X-ray radiation escape from the first generations of galaxies heating and ionising their surroundings and subsequently the entire intergalactic medium. There is strong observational evidence that cosmic reionisation ended approximately one billion years after the Big Bang, but there are still uncertainties that will be clarified with upcoming optical, infrared, and radio facilities in the next decade. This article gives an introduction to the theoretical and observational aspects of cosmic reionisation and discusses their role in our understanding of early galaxy formation and cosmology.},

	abstract = {The thermal and chemical evolution of a collapsing spherical cloud composed of pure hydrogen gas is investigated. It is assumed that the cloud is in pressure-free collapse. Over a broad range of initial conditions, virtually all the gas is converted to molecular form by a density n = 10 to the 12th/cu cm. The reactions found to be most effective are the three-body ones: H + H + H yielding H2 + H; and H + H + H2 yielding 2H2. As a consequence of significant cooling from the molecules, the temperature rise is slowed, and the Jeans mass eventually falls below 0.1 solar mass for clouds less massive than 100 solar masses. Such clouds should thus be capable of fragmenting into low-mass stars. This conclusion is even more valid if angular momentum slows the collapse. Also included in a heuristic manner is the effect of shock heating from colliding fragments in a turbulent collapsing cloud. Owing to the early destruction of hydrogen molecules, the Jeans mass cannot drop as far with substantial heating.The primordial stellar mass spectrum may thus be a sensitive function of the degree and effectiveness of intercloud collisions.},

	abstract = {At present, interstellar molecular hydrogen is incapable of detection, although a high abundance has been suspected for almost two decades. In the present paper, an analysis is given of the various processes which determine the molecular concentration in H I clouds. The most important mechanism for forming molecular hydrogen is association on the surface of the interstellar grains, the characteristic time for conversion to molecular form being about 100 years. It is shown that the range of grain temperatures where this recombination reaction is efficient is coincident with the range K, which is expected to resuit from the interaction with the interstellar radiation field. It is estimated that the efficiency (recombination coefficient) of the process is between 0.1 and 1. Regarding dissociative processes, photodissociation through the forbidden transition between the two Heitler-London states of the molecule, previously thought to be most important, is shown to be negligible. Ionization and dissociation of a cloud by random encounters with 0 and B stars occurs about once every 100 years, so that if the grain recombination process is operative, a balance results in which the molecular abundance is roughly comparable with the observed atomic concentration. The cooling properties of molecular hydrogen are discussed.},
